The attempt to create let z = &mut x; immediately after let y = &mut x; violates Rustâ€™s rule that you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This rule is enforced to prevent data races. See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules for more information.

    // creates a mutable reference to x. During the lifetime of y, no other mutable references to x can be created.
    let y = &mut x; 
    *y += 100; // dereference y (with *) and add 100 to x

    let z = &mut x;
    *z += 1000;
